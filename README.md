# ThanksgivingMod

For the thanksgiving holiday (US) I made a mod!  Collect Turkey, Stuffing, and Pumpkin Pie to create a Thanksgiving dinner!  Once the Thanksgiving Dinner is crafted, you can give it to a faction rep for reputation! Or you can sell it to a trader for a cool 150,000 credits.  You can find the ingriedients at stations or in ship loot.

Note: Mod is still in-progress, will anounce when ready.
